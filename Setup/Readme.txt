Torrent Autodownloader Readme

0. Grant administrative access to the setup when prompted. 

1. Enter torrent path carefully. If you want to change the path, re-execute the setup, no problem (no quotes).

2. In the location entered, a new folder will be created "Torrent Autodownloader", which hosts a file "The List.txt". Edit this file to add more shows.

3. This program just downloads torrent files in a folder "Torrent Files". Configure your torrent client to monitor that folder.

4. When modifying the "The List.txt" file, be careful to enter name accurately, without any capital letters, using hyphens instead of spaces. Be careful of starting and trailing spaces. In case of any confusion, contact me ;) 
A sample "The List" file is added already, look at it, and feel free to modify it to add/remove shows.

5. This program configures itself to run at startup automatically. For different behaviour, contact me!

6. You can also run this program by typing "torrent" into  the command line (without quotes, of course).

Have fun. Hopefully it helps make your torrenting experience more efficient!
